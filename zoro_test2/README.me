This is a simple Cypress Test using Zoro website

Installing NPM 
 npm install
Install Cypress via npm:
cd /your/project/path
npm install cypress --save-dev



To run a command, you’ll need to prefix each command in order to properly locate the cypress executable.
$(npm bin)/cypress run
…or…
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run

1a. Zoro0 and Zoro1 both perform the initial tasks, but Zoro1 goes further and will Login
using the given login credentials. 

BDD scenario for successful login using Zoro1.feature which called uped beforeEach.js,different.js
openingZoror1.js and enter.js 

1b - Standard JavaScript code used, coupled with Cypress Framework. It is a standard page node_module as it 
navigates to the login page, followed by login details. Code is built with BDD thinking, 
Cucumber, Feature Files, JavaScript and Cypress Test Framework and is fast.

1c - Non Happy Path. On arriving to the Login Area using Zoro0, there seems to a Cross Browser Scripting error in 
Cypress. Seemed to have fixed it with error handling on Zero1 Feature. It works fine. 


Zoro0 - Had errors with Cross-Browser Issues on Giving part
- so error handling added on Zoro1

(
Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
  return false;
});

  Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
    // returning false here prevents Cypress from
    // failing the test
    return false
  })

  it('Does not catch script error', () => {
    Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
      throw err
    })
  
    cy.visit(url);

)

Fixes Error 

2. Standard Form.

  Scenario - Need to ensure all relevant fields are filled in.
  Scenario - Need to ensure that password conform to all requirements
  Scenario - Need to ensure any formatted fields like telephone or mobile are correct
  Scenario - Need to ensure Terms/Conditions is ticketed before accepting records
  

3. The 3m logo not correct on the front page. Sorry, I wish I had more time to find more.


4. a) When I perform a search for a list of products, then add to the basket, it prompts me to carry
on. It would be great to get back to previous search list rather than main product, so 
that I can buy products from my original search.

b) When I look at the main page, I see adverts, logos, but I don't see a ticker or pages
showing special offers, or excessive stock, or stock you need to shift because of a newer
version / upgrade of equipment or stock? 

c) I know you use cookies, but could not deduce if you can place the top categories for each 
user so that you can easily sell to them.
